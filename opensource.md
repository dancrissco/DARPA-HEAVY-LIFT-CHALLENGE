HawaFrame – Open Hardware Initiative for the DARPA Lift Challenge
Project Overview

HawaFrame is an open-hardware, lightweight VTOL airframe concept designed to meet the DARPA Lift Challenge requirement of a 55-lb maximum airframe capable of lifting a 110-lb payload over a 5-nautical-mile mission.
The design uses an RF-welded inflatable tubular structure, modular corner pods, and open flight-control architecture.

By open-sourcing this work, we aim to accelerate experimentation, collaboration, and engineering innovation in lightweight, high-efficiency aerial lift systems.

Open Hardware License

All mechanical designs, diagrams, schematics, CAD models, inflatable structure designs, payload cradle concepts, and assembly instructions in this repository are made available under the:

CERN Open Hardware License Version 2 – Permissive (CERN-OHL-P)
You are free to study, modify, manufacture, and distribute this hardware, including commercially, provided that you include the same license notice and disclaimers.
