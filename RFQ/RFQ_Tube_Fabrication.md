Master RFQ Package — DARPA Lift Challenge / Inflatable VTOL Drone

This package covers every subsystem you will need quotes for, regardless of whether the vendor is a composites specialist, RF-welding shop, machining house, PCB fabricator, or drone electronics supplier.

RFQ-0: Overview / Cover Letter (Template)

Project: DARPA Lift Challenge – Inflatable Airframe Quad-Lift VTOL
Organization: Daria / HawaFrame
Contact: [Name, Email, Phone]
Target Delivery: [Insert desired date]

Summary:
We are developing a 55-lb maximum-weight VTOL platform capable of lifting a minimum 110-lb payload over a 5-nautical-mile mission in accordance with DARPA’s Lift Challenge specifications.

The airframe uses a lightweight RF-welded inflatable tubular structure supporting four propulsion pods and a central payload cradle.

We are seeking quotes for specific subsystems described in the attached RFQs.
Vendors may quote one or multiple sections depending on capabilities.

RFQ-1: Inflatable Airframe (RF-Welded Tubular Structure)

Scope:
Design + manufacturing of an inflatable, RF-welded, TPU/PVC air-beam structure.

Requirements:

Shape: square or circular ring

OD: ~1.6–1.8 m spanning rotor-to-rotor

Tube diameter: 80–120 mm (inflated)

Load rating: support webbing & saddle mounts for 110-lb hanging payload

Chambers: 4 independent air chambers (redundancy)

Pressure: 3–6 psi operational

Interface: fabric receivers for hardpoints or clamp-on saddles

Material: TPU, PVC, or hybrid reinforced textiles

Prefer RF-welded construction

Provide:

Estimated weight

Burst rating

Recommended bladder + outer shell configuration

Valve & inflation options

RFQ-2: Motor Pod Saddles (CNC/Composite Rigid Mounts)

Scope:
Rigid saddles that clamp onto the inflatable tube and provide a stable mounting base for propulsion pods.

Requirements:

Clamp around 80–120 mm inflatable tubes without puncture

Material: Aluminum 6061-T6, 7075, carbon composite, or reinforced polymer

4 saddles total

Each saddle supports:

1 motor + 1 ESC (approx. 3–5 lb static load)

Small wiring harness

Must resist torsion from 1–2 kW motors

Provide finite element sanity check (optional)

RFQ-3: Propulsion System (Motor + Prop + ESC Pack)

Note: Vendors can quote full systems or components individually.

Requirements:

4 propulsion pods

Motor thrust (sea level, static): ≥ 60 lb per motor

Rotor diameter: 31–36 inches (0.8–0.9 m)

Prop material: carbon fiber

ESCs: rated for peak power 4–5 kW, continuous 2–3 kW

Kv range: 80–150 depending on prop diameter

Provide:

Performance curves

Thrust vs voltage vs power consumption

Weight per pod

Wiring diagram

Mounting pattern

RFQ-4: Battery System + BMS

Requirements:

Energy target: 1.2–1.5 kWh total

Chemistry: Li-ion high-C or LiPo high-current packs

Weight target: 11–15 lb

Continuous discharge capacity: ≥ 150 A

BMS:

Cell balancing

Over-temp, under-voltage

High-current pack safe-discharge

Provide:

Pack configuration (S/P)

Connectors

Weight

Cycle life

Mechanical mounting recommendations

RFQ-5: Avionics / Flight Control

Requirements:

Flight controller: Pixhawk 6X or equivalent

GNSS with RTK optional

Telemetry: 900 MHz + Wi-Fi/BT

ESC communication: CAN preferred

Redundant power module

Logging capability

Provide configuration notes for a 165-lb takeoff weight quad-lift VTOL

RFQ-6: Payload Cradle + Webbing / Cable Mounts

Requirements:

Payload: 110 lb Olympic plates

Must not use plates as structural members

Cradle:

Vertical shaft for plates

Clamp/collar

Material: steel or aluminum

Hanging via four steel cables or tactical webbing to central hardpoint

Include quick-release system for ground unloading only (not mid-air)

RFQ-7: Wiring Harness + Power Distribution

Requirements:

High-current distribution bus: 150–200 A

4 ESC supply lines

Avionics 5–12V rails

Anti-spark connectors

EMI shielding

Waterproofing as needed

Mounting of saddles

Integration of propulsion pods

Wiring and battery installation

Avionics configuration

Bench testing + vibration check

Provide labor hours estimate

RFQ-9: Test Stand / Thrust Rig

Requirements:

Custom or off-the-shelf rig to measure:

Motor static thrust up to 80 lb

Vibration

Power draw up to 6 kW

Include sensors, data logging
